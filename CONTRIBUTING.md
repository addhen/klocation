### Building the project

The project is built with Gradle. Given it is multiplatform, you can build it for the JVM and Native.

To build the project use

**Android**

`./gradlew assemble bundle`

**iOS**

Open the `sample/ios/iosApp` project in Xcode. Then [build and run](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/building-and-running-an-app) it from Xcode.

Run to see all supported tasks:
`./gradlew tasks --all`


#### Importing into Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA

To import into Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA, just open up the `root` of the project folder. Android Studio or IntelliJ IDEA should automatically detect
that it is a Gradle project and import it. It's important that you make sure that all building and test operations
are delegated to Gradle under [Gradle Settings](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/gradle-settings.html).

**Note**: You may need to install the pre-commit hook to ensure that the code style is consistent. To do this, run `./install_hooks.sh`.
